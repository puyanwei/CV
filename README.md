## Skills

### Commitment

I love to [blog](https://medium.com/@pyan) regularly and one of my [blog posts](https://medium.com/hackernoon/reacting-to-react-js-10ff1d50a36c) on React has over 10k views.

I am very driven to learning, I love doing [side projects](https://github.com/puyanwei). I am committed improving and continuously creating new applications to embrace the unknown of new technologies.

### Teamwork

Iâ€™m a great team player, and love collaboration. I love working in a team, using stand ups, and retrospectives at the end of our sprints. I'm happy to review each other's work and improve. I love teaching coding and helping others. I have a great team mindset and want to experience the highs and lows together.

### Initiative

I managed to teach and sustain myself running my own business in online poker. Soon I was able to develop a website where we would teach clients our knowledge in return for sharing profits.

I gave up online poker and decided to pursue the goal of learning to code. Within 4 months I had learned some Java, Javascript, completed some courses on udacity and freecodecamp, and built some basic games.
