Hi there! I am a graduate of Makers Academy and an ex online poker player who gave it all up to pursue an amazing career of a developer. I am looking for work as a Front End Developer.

I have already have work experience developing the rebrand website design of a start up. We used technologies in Vue.js, Webpack, ES6 Javascript and SASS whilst working in a team in an agile fashion.

I'm interested in the creation and exploration of ideas. As a graduate of the London College of Communication in Interactive Design, I have always been interested in how people and technology interact within different environments.

## SKILLS

### Commitment

I love to [blog](https://thep-log.blogspot.co.uk/) regularly and mine has 90,000+ views, with over 130 posts at the moment and I recently transitioned it from talking about poker to coding.

I am very driven to learning, I code almost every day. During and after Makers I have been commuting to London from Milton Keynes. I am committed improving and continuously creating new applications to embrace the unknown of new technologies.

### Teamwork

I’m a great team player, and love collaboration. I loved the group projects at Makers, of which we applied everything we learned to imitate a dev team in a work environment. We made sure we had great communication using stand ups and retros, applied XP values, and added small features to our product in an agile fashion. We went through our ups and downs together, as a team.

### Initiative

I managed to teach and sustain myself running my own business in online poker. Soon I was able to develop a website where we would teach clients our knowledge in return for sharing profits.

I gave up online poker and decided to pursue the goal of learning to code. Within 4 months I had learned Java, Javascript, completed some courses on udacity and freecodecamp, and built some basic games.

### Creativity

I pride myself on being a creative person. Many of my ideas for projects at Makers ended up making the final cut, including the final project, which was to build a desktop app from scratch.

A project I worked on in University was to debunk the idea that advertising has to spammy in order to be successful. We left branded items around south London and organised [stunts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry-25_HDpWs) with a link to our campaign.
