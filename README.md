Hi there! I am a graduate of Makers Academy and an ex online poker player who gave it all up to pursue an amazing career of a developer. I am looking for work as a Junior Developer.

I'm interested in the creation and exploration of ideas. As a graduate of the London College of Communication in Interactive Design, I have always been interested in how people and technology interact within different environments.

I absolutely love the process of learning. "Enjoy the Process Towards Mastery" is one of my life mottos, inspired from Daniel Pink's amazing book [Drive](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Drive-Daniel-H-Pink/dp/184767769X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1501344243&sr=8-1&keywords=daniel+pink+drive). There I have learned to not be too attached to the results of success or failure to keep striving for self improvement.

## SKILLS

### Creativity

I pride myself on being a creative person. Many of my ideas for projects at Makers ended up making the final cut, including the final project, which was to build a desktop app from scratch.

A project I worked on in University was to debunk the idea that advertising has to spammy in order to be successful. We left branded items around south London and organised [stunts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry-25_HDpWs) with a link to our campaign.

### Commitment

I love to [blog](https://thep-log.blogspot.co.uk/) regularly and mine has almost 90,000 views, with over 130 posts at the moment and I recently transitioned it from talking about poker to coding.

I am very committed to learning, I code every day. During and after Makers I have been coming to London from Milton Keynes everyday without fail. I am driven to keep improving and aim to continuously create new applications embracing the unknown of new technologies.

### Initiative

I managed to teach and sustain myself running my own business in online poker. Soon I was able to develop a website where we would teach clients our knowledge in return for sharing profits.

I gave up online poker and decided to pursue the goal of learning to code. Within 4 months I had learned Java, Javascript, completed some courses on udacity and freecodecamp, and built some basic games.

### Teamwork

During Makers Academy I found working in a team an invaluable experience. It was satisfying to have everyone all work towards a common goal and see it all come together in the end.

It was great to practice Agile methodologies starting out with user stories and small goals. We used XP values, we communicated openly and equally using stand ups and retrospectives.
