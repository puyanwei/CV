Hi there! I am currently student of Makers Academy and an ex online poker player who gave it all up to pursue an amazing career of a developer.

I'm interested in the creation and exploration of ideas. As a graduate of the London College of Communication in Interactive Design, I have always been interested in how people and technology interact within different environments.

I absolutely love the process of learning. "Enjoy the Process Towards Mastery" is one of my life mottos, inspired from Daniel Pink's amazing book "Drive". There I have learned to not be too attached to the results of success or failure to keep striving for self improvement.


##SKILLS

###Analytics and Adaptability

The fast pace world of online poker demanded a lot of quick efficient decision making skills whilst under constant pressure. This is ramped up by playing multiple tables at the same time simultaneously, usually up to 18 in order to increase my hourly.

Offline study helped me with improving on-the-fly equity analysis and mathematical calculations as well as adjusting to opponent tendencies according to the data collected, allowing myself to implement the most efficient strategy.


###Initiative and Commitment

I managed to teach and sustain myself running my own business in online poker.

Soon I was able to work with another partner in developing website where we would teach clients our knowledge in return for sharing profits. Maintaining the website involved managing the forums, videos, filtering and selecting applicants and creating an automated record keeping system to keep track of all of the students. Much is learnt when teaching others.

At the end of 2016, I gave up online poker and decided to pursue the goal of learning to code. This was a simple transition for myself due to my experience with scheduling and studying. Within 4 months I had learned Java, Javascript, completed some courses on udacity and freecodecamp, and built some basic games. Commitment is not an issue with me when I know what I want.


###Creativity

A project I worked as a team to  was to debunk the idea that advertising has to spammy in order to be successful. We created a campaign called "Off The Wall", of which various items were left around south London with our branding and a link to our website that explained what we were trying to achieve. This ended in an exhibition event of our work.

I led and organized the team into smaller groups according to the item type and our scheduling. The result was that we delivered a website that was documenting in realtime that advertising can be memorable and personal.

My blog has 90,000 views at the moment and I recently transitioned it from talking about poker to coding. During my successes in poker I chose to travel, exploring Asia mostly. My mentality is to make sure that the topics are accessible, understandable and fun to my audience regardless if they have advanced knowledge about it. I aimed to get more people interested in poker this way, and I want to do the same thing with coding.
