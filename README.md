Hi there! I am a graduate of Makers Academy Coding Boot Camp and an ex online poker player continuing my career in software development. I am currently looking for work as a Front End Web Developer.

I have already have work experience developing the rebrand website design of a start up. We used technologies in Vue.js, Webpack, ES6 Javascript and SASS whilst working in a team in an agile fashion.

I'm interested in the creation and exploration of ideas. As a graduate of the London College of Communication in Interactive Design, I have always been interested in how people and technology interact within different environments.

## Work Experience

-   Creating pages based on the graphic designer's specifications.

-   Picking up tickets to fix functional and visual bugs.

-   Good git and github processes, using branches and regular commits with good descriptions.

-   Good communication with my team via daily stand ups and retrospectives at the end of sprints.

-   Coded using Vue.js with Vuex implementation. Adhered to a strict Air bnb style linting and SCSS format using CSS Grid layout.

-   Using ES6 Javascript to create and debug logic within the webpack application.

#### Self-Employed Online Poker Professional (2010 - 2016)

## Skills

### Commitment

I love to [blog](https://thep-log.blogspot.co.uk/) regularly and mine has 90,000+ views, with over 130 posts at the moment and I recently transitioned it from talking about poker to coding.

I am very driven to learning, I code almost every day with side projects. During and after Makers I had been commuting to London from Milton Keynes. I am committed improving and continuously creating new applications to embrace the unknown of new technologies.

### Teamwork

Iâ€™m a great team player, and love collaboration. I loved the collaborative nature of working in a team, using stand ups, and retrospective at the end of our sprints for continuous communication. We made sure we added small commits to the website in an agile fashion. We went through our ups and downs together, as a team.

### Initiative

I managed to teach and sustain myself running my own business in online poker. Soon I was able to develop a website where we would teach clients our knowledge in return for sharing profits.

I gave up online poker and decided to pursue the goal of learning to code. Within 4 months I had learned Java, Javascript, completed some courses on udacity and freecodecamp, and built some basic games.

### Creativity

I pride myself on being a creative person. Many of my ideas for projects at Makers ended up making the final cut, including the final project, which was to build a desktop app from scratch.

A project I worked on in University was to debunk the idea that advertising has to spammy in order to be successful. We left branded items around south London and organised [stunts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry-25_HDpWs) with a link to our campaign.
